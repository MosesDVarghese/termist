# Termist

Built on alacritty, the aim of this project is to create a minimal runnable terminal in Rust.

### TODO

[âœ“] strip alacritty down to a minimal runnable version (remove folders and files that are not needed for running)

[ ] break down application to barebones terminal emulator

[ ] make code optimizations to prioritize lightweight and low resource footprint over speed and high performance
